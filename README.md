This project include both frontend  and backend.



In the beginning get matchesRaw.json file which is located inside backend folder then create a database called MyNewDatabase and create collection called matches. Then import that matchesRaw.

Then run this command inside backend folder "node app.js".This will start the nodejs server. Then to test it run "http://localhost:8080/" using web browser this will display all the data inside json file.

Then run the react native app using "npm run android" command. In here i use my mobile then use computer IP and nodejs server running port as url. ex:-"http://192.168.8.101:101/".

If you host that app.js then use that host url as fetch URL.
